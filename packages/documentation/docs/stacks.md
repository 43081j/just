Just also provides what we call "stacks" to complete the workflow of building a repository. Just Stacks are:

1. a project generator for single package or monorepo repository
2. a set of scripts to help keep the generated project up-to-date with the template that generated the project

## Generate a new project

Just Stack is really easy to create! We have taken care to make this experience as fast as possible. You can create a project in a couple of seconds:

```
mkdir someproject
cd someproject
npm init just
```

This will present you with a choice of several project types. Choose one to get started with a just-stack generated project!
